        <h3>Overview</h3>
        
        <p>Sync workouts provides the facility for coaches to create workouts and send 
        them to players. The players then complete the workouts and return them at which
        point the coach can view progress. <i>Quick bit of terminolog: A requested workout is called a Routine. 
        A practice is the players attempt at the workout, and has associated outcomes.</i>
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Both coach and player <b>must</b> be registered</li>
            <li>The player must have email information in the team list</li>
            <li>Connection to the internet is required to perform the actual sync</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The sync workflow proceeds as follows:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Coach creates a workout and tags it to be sent to player(s)</li>
            <li>Coach sends workouts to players</li>
            <li>Player(s) retrieve the workouts requested</li>
            <li>Player completes the request workouts</li>
            <li>Player sends completed workouts to coach</li>
            <li>Coach retrieves completed workouts</li>
