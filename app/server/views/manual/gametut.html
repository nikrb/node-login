        <p>
            This tutorial guides the user through creating a game, entering shots
            and viewing the shots graphically and statistically.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Creating your first game</h3>
        <p>
          Return to the home screen and click the Game button. There won't be any games listed
          so click the plus symbol top right to create a new game. Enter the venue and opposing
          team's name and click save.
          Select the game you just created from the game list and you will be taken to the shot
          input screen. <i>Note the view moves to landscape giving the highest resolution
          for placing shots on the court. Portrait orientation is <b>not currently supported</b>
          for the game views.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          To enter a shot first select a player from the list on the left. Then click
          in the court area where the player took a shot from. Finally change the filters
          to the right of the screen to specfiy the type of shot.
        </p>
        <p>
          To enter subsequent shots, start by selecting the player - if it's the 
          same player no need. Enter the shot and set the filters. You can change the
          shot filters up to the point you select a new player or enter a new shot.
        </p>
        <h3>Shot Views</h3>
        <p>
          To see the entered shots, select the view icon in the tab bar at the
          bottom of the screen. Adjust the filters to the right to see the shots
          you are interested in. Selecting off for a filter shows all shots related
          to that filter, ie. if you select off for the made/miss filter, both will
          be shown, made shots in a green colour and missed in red.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can show/hide both the individual shot (circles) and the shot segment
            split by toggling the two switches to the right, under the filters.
        </p>
        <h4>Send Email</h4>
        <p>
            You can send any shot view setup to anyone using their email address.
            When you have the view showing the info you want to display, click the 
            email button. You can then enter email addresses from your contacts list
            by click the To: button at the top left. You can also enter a subject
            and a message, like a normal email. You will see a preview of the view
            to be sent to the right. Click Send button in the top nav bar to send
            the image in a pdf document format.
