        <h3>Step Three: Name Player(s)</h3>
        <p>In order to send a routine to a player, the player needs an email address. We will
        just edit one player for the purposes of this tutorial. Note the routine isn't sent 
        via email, but in the system; email uniquely identifies someone.</p>
        <p>
            From the home screen, click the Team Button and you should see a list of players. Click
            on the first player and you should see the player details. Either select a player
            from your contacts list, or enter their name and email manually.

        <h3>Step Four: Create a Workout</h3>

        <p>
            From the home screen, click the Workouts button. The workout list should be empty.
            Click the plus (+) sign at the top right to create a new workout.

            Then click Done to return to the workout detail view and click Save.
        </p>
        <img src="img/manual/drillListSelection.png">
        <h3>Step Five: Assign Workout to Player(s)</h3>
        <p>
            You should still be in the workouts screen, if not, click the workouts 
            button in the home screen.
        </p>
        <img src='img/manual/workoutListWithWorkout.png' >
        <p>
            Click the envelope icon on the workout line to assign a requested routine
            to a player(s).
        </p>
        <img src='img/manual/workoutPlayerSelection.png' >
        <p>
            Select the player we entered the email for and click Save.
            <i>You can select multiple players here, but for this tutorial we only
            have one player with an email.</i>
        </p>
        <img src='img/manual/workoutListWithRoutine.png' >
        <p>
            The workout list should now contain an entry in the Requested section.
            Note the user the routine is destined for.
        </p>
        <h3>Step Six: Perform Sync</h3>
        <p>
            To actually send the workout to players we need to perform a sync.
            There are two types of sync, coach and player. Player sync lets players
            retrieve workouts requested by their coach and return them when they have
            completed them. Coach sync lets coach send workouts to players and
            retrieve them to view the outcome when the player has completed them.
            We will be using coach sync for this tutorial.
        </p>
        <p>
            Return to the home page and ensure we are logged in. The home screen should 
            display your name and logout in the top right if you are logged in, if 
            login is displayed, click it and login.
            From the home screen, click the sync button. You will now see the sync
            screen with a whirring activity indicator, when it stops whirring 
            you will see the list of requested routines.
        </p>
        <img src='img/manual/syncRoutinesWaiting.png'>
        <p>
            Click the Coach Sync button and the activity indicator will start to whir again.
            When it stops whirring you should see the sent routine listed, see image below.
        </p>
        <img src='img/manual/syncRequestedRoutines.png'>
        <p>
            Note the sync output:
            <ul>
                <li>No New Drills To Process - We didn't create any new drills</li>
                <li>Routine:workout 1 [requested] to [bea@gmail.com] and ok - The
                routine was sent successfully</li>
                <li>Workout:workout 1 - We created a new workout, which was successfully
                sent</li>
                <li>No Completed Routines Found - There were no player completed
                routines to fetch</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Step Seven: Wait</h3>
        <p>Now we wait for the targetted player to complete the routine and
        return it to us. This will be covered in another tutorial</p>
        <h3>Step Eight: Retrieve Completed Routines</h3>
        <p>
            From time to time you will want to check for any routine requests completed
            by players. Ensure you are logged in at the home screen, then click the
            sync button. Wait for the activity indicator to stop whirring and then
            click the coach sync button. The activity indicator will start to whir again
            and when it stops, any returned routines will be listed, see image below.
        </p>
        <img src='img/manual/syncReturnedRoutines.png' >
        <h3>Step Nine: Check Outcomes</h3>
        <p>
            Finally, we want to see how well the player performed the requested routines.
            Navigate to the home page and click the Practice Reports button. This will
            take you to the practice list, as shown below.
        </p>
        <img src='img/manual/practiceReportList.png'>
        <p>
            Notice the practice list has three sections.
            <ul>
                <li>Orphan - this shows practices who's workouts have been
                deleted.</li>
                <li>Workout Name - Each workout is listed as a section, with each
                practice performed and the date. <i>This shows practices completed
                by me, meaning me as a player having practiced a workout locally using
                my device - in other words, private player practices that were
                not requested by coach</i></li>
                <li>
                    Routines - This section lists the workout practices completed and returned
                    by players to their coach.
                </li>
            </ul>
            For the purposes of the tutorial, we have one listed in the requested
            section. In order to see the outcome, click on the routine and you will 
            be presented with a view showing the outcome for each drill in the workout.
        </p>
