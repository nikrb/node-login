        <h2>Player Sync Tutorial</h2>
        <p>
            This tutorial goes through the player side of the workouts sync operation.
            It covers retrieval of workouts, completing the exercises and returning
            to coach. In order to complete this tutorial both player and coach must
            be registered.
        </p>
        <h3>Step One: Retrieving Requested Routines</h3>
        <p>
            First make sure you are logged in. In the home screen Your name and Logout
            should be displayed at the top right. If Login is displayed, click it and
            login. Once logged in click the sync button.
        </p>
        <p>
            You will now see the sync
            screen with a whirring activity indicator, when it stops whirring 
            the sync buttons are enabled. Click the Player Sync button and wait
            while the activity indicator whirs again for a short while.
            The activity indicator stops whirring when the operation is complete.
        </p>

        <p>
            Take a moment to look at the results. The routine is for workout1 which
            has just been retrieved and is targetted at (or, to) me, Bea - or you of course.
            There are no completed routines to return to coach as yet.
        </p>
        <h3>Step Two: Complete Requested Routines</h3>
        <p>
            Return to the home screen, you should still be logged in - if not, login.
            Click the workouts button to go to the workouts list, see the image below.
        </p>
        <img src='img/manual/playerWorkoutsFetched.png' >
        <p>
            The image shows two workouts listed in two different sections.
            The workouts section lists all workouts on your device - this tutorial
            does not address this section, but for your infomation: A new workout
            was created when we retrieved the workouts requested by the coach earlier.
            You can practice this workout by clickng the basketball icon and this will
            not affect the coach requested workout.
            The envelope icon creates a routine to be requested from another player - 
            in effect how coach sent you the workout. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The Requested section lists those workouts specifically requested by
            coach and the section this tutorial deals with. In order to practice
            the requested workout, click on the basketball icon. You can also click
            on the workout name to see the drills associated with the workout. Finally
            you can delete the workout - though we don't want to do that right now!
        </p>
        <p>
            Click the basketball icon in the Requested section for the workout and
            you should navigate to the detail view which shows the workout
            with all it's drills listed, see image below. Note the share button at
            the top right - this will be enabled only when the practice is complete.
        </p>
        <img src='img/manual/playerRoutineDetail.png' >
        <p>
            To complete the workout, go through each drill and complete it by 
            filling in the outcome.
            <ol>
                <li>to see what the drill entails, click on the i (infomation)
                icon to the left of the drill name.</li>
                <li>To complete a drill, click on the drill row and you will
                navigate to the outcome screen which you should fill in</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <img src='img/manual/playerOutcomeView.png'>
        <p>
            Navigate back to the home screen when all drills of the workout are
            completed.
        </p>
        <h3>Step Three: Return Completed Routines to Coach</h3>
        <p>
            Make sure you are logged in and click the sync button. You should
            see the completed routine listed when the activity indicator ceases whirring.
        </p>
        <img src='img/manual/playerCompletedRoutine.png' >
        <p>
            Click the Player Sync button and the completed workout should be
            returned back to coach.
